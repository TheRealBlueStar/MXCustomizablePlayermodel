 To use these playermodels, here is a quick step by step process.

 HOW TO USE MODELS
 1. Download the "Customizable Playermodels" mod for your    respective version of Minecraft.
 2. In your Minecraft root directory, add a folder named "player_models"
 3. To use your models, simple drag and drop any .cpmproject files with "exported" in their name into the "player_models" folder.
 4. When in-game in Minecraft, press the G key. This should open up the CPM menu. From there, you can do a variety fo things, including:
 - Playing a model's animations, turning on and off skin layers, as well as resetting gestures/emotes and poses.
 - Turning off your model by clicking "Render Models [Not Bound]" until there is no X.
 - Reloading your models.
 - And many other things.

 But in this menu, simply click "Models", find your model, then click "Apply". Have fun with your new model(s).

 HOW TO EDIT MODELS
 1. Go to your Minecraft home page, and in the top left corner, there will be a button labelled "Open Skin Editor".
 2. In the Skin Editor, click "File", and then "Load".
 3. From the new pop-up, it's preferred to click the 3 dots icon just above the "Ok" so you can properly browse your computer's files. Look for projects specifically ending in "NameProject.cpmproject".
 4. Double click your project, and then, when sent back to Minecraft, simply click "Ok". Your CPM Model should be on display and you can edit any aspect of it.
 5. ALWAYS REMEMBER TO SAVE OFTEN! If not, the mod autosaves often in-case.
